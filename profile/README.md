Welcome to the organisation page for EastAnt-Atlantis. The model aims to represent interactions between species and groups present in East Antarctic marine environments. The domain consists of 29 polygons, each representing a different biological and physical regime. 

Physical drivers (i.e., currents, temperature, salinity) are obtained from the output of ACCESS-OM2, a physical model described by Kiss et al. 2020 (link: [https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/13/401/2020/]); ecologically important variables, such as sea ice seasonality and mixed layer depth, were validated by Fierro-Arcos et al. 2023 (link: [https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0079661123000927]).
