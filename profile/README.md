## What is Atlantis?
Welcome to the EastAnt-Atlantis model page. Atlantis is an end-to-end ecosystem model that represents interactions between all levels and spheres (i.e., physical, chemical, biological, economic, social, and more) of an ecosystem; it was developed by Dr. Beth Fulton at CSIRO (for more information, see [https://research.csiro.au/atlantis/]). Atlantis' strength lies in its ability to simulate long-term scenarios, such as the impact of human activities and climate change, to aid management and decision-making; due to its complexity, it requires the input of several experts and careful calibration.

## Atlantis for East Antarctica
### Why East Antarctica?
East Antarctica, specifically the Prydz Bay area, is a region that encompasses several habitats and rich ecosystems which rely on the seasonal ice cover and availability of krill and fish. Prydz Bay has been identified as an important habitat for commercially important species such as toothfish (*Dissostichus spp.*) and Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*); it is also breeding and feeding grounds for several charismatic species, such as the iconic emperor penguin (*Aptenodytes forsteri*) and elephant seal (*Mirounga leonina*). 

The domain consists of 29 polygons, each representing a different biological and physical regime. 

Physical drivers (i.e., currents, temperature, salinity) are obtained from the output of ACCESS-OM2, a physical model described by Kiss et al. 2020; ecologically important variables, such as sea ice seasonality and mixed layer depth, were validated by Fierro-Arcos et al. 2023.
